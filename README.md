This Jupyter notebook includes a numerical simulation to demonstrate that in the presence of cell segmentation errors may lead to a non-constant relative growth rate with increasing cell area. 
It teaches that when ther is a cell area over-estimation bias (for isntance 0.3 μm<sup>2</sup>) leads to an apparent increase in the relative growth rate with cell area. This increase is not due to a deviation from scalable growth, but an artifact due to cell segmentation bias on the phase contrast channel.
